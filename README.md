# 407-Cost-Tracker

## Problem
Exercise - Create a simple toll calculator Write a program that calculates
the cost of a vehicle driving from one point on 407ETR, to another point. For
this exercise, the toll rate will be $0.25/km . Please use the file
`interchanges.json` to calculate the distances between interchanges.

## Requirements
I used Java with the netbeans IDE and a json library called `com.google.gson` which was developed by google. I chose this particular library after testing out others and concluding that this was the best because it is better documented and works with little unpredictability.

## Solution
